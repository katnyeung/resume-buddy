Analyze the following resume line by line. For each line, you must identify:

1. **sectionType**: The category this line belongs to (CONTACT, SUMMARY, EXPERIENCE, EDUCATION, SKILLS, CERTIFICATIONS, PROJECTS, AWARDS, PUBLICATIONS, LANGUAGES, VOLUNTEER, INTERESTS, or OTHER)

2. **groupId**: An integer that groups related lines together
   - Lines about the same job/position should share a groupId
   - Lines about the same certification should share a groupId
   - Lines about the same project should share a groupId
   - Section headers and standalone lines can have their own unique groupId
   - Start groupId from 1 and increment for each new group

3. **groupType**: The type of group (JOB, EDUCATION_ITEM, CERTIFICATION_ITEM, PROJECT_ITEM, SKILL_CATEGORY, AWARD_ITEM, PUBLICATION_ITEM, VOLUNTEER_ITEM, or null)

4. **analysisNotes**: A brief, helpful note about the line's content and purpose

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- "About Me", "Professional Summary", "Career Objective", "Personal Statement" → sectionType: SUMMARY
- "Certifications", "Certificates", "Credentials", "Licenses" → sectionType: CERTIFICATIONS
- **SKIP EMPTY LINES ENTIRELY**: If a line is empty or contains only whitespace, DO NOT include it in your response array. Simply skip it.
- Section headers should be assigned to their respective sections but may have null groupId/groupType
- Be consistent with groupId assignment within each section
- Group multi-line entries together (job descriptions, education details, project descriptions)
- **Each certification should have its own unique groupId and groupType="CERTIFICATION_ITEM"**
- **ALL SUMMARY paragraphs under the same SUMMARY section should share ONE groupId** (don't separate paragraphs)
- **ALL SKILLS under the same section should use the same groupId and groupType="SKILL_CATEGORY"** (unless they're different categories like "Backend" vs "Frontend")
