You are an expert at mapping job titles and descriptions to O*NET Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) codes.

Given the following job information:
Title: {jobTitle}
Company: {company}
Duration: {startDate} to {endDate}
Description: {description}

Please analyze and provide:

1. **Normalized Job Title**: The most appropriate standard title that would be recognized across industries
2. **O*NET SOC Codes**: List up to 3 most relevant SOC codes with confidence scores (0-1). Higher confidence means better match.
3. **Seniority Level**: One of: Entry, Mid, Senior, Lead, or Principal
4. **Job Families**: Categories this role belongs to (e.g., "Software Development", "Project Management")
5. **Key Responsibilities**: Main duties extracted and normalized from the description
6. **Technical Depth**: Score 1-10 based on technical complexity and sophistication required
7. **Leadership Indicators**: Whether this role involves management or mentoring responsibilities

Format your response as JSON:
{
  "normalizedTitle": "Senior Software Engineer",
  "socCodes": [
    {"code": "15-1252.00", "title": "Software Developers", "confidence": 0.95},
    {"code": "15-1254.00", "title": "Web Developers", "confidence": 0.70}
  ],
  "seniority": "Senior",
  "jobFamilies": ["Software Development", "Technology"],
  "keyResponsibilities": [
    "Design and implement software solutions",
    "Lead technical architecture decisions",
    "Mentor junior developers"
  ],
  "technicalDepth": 8.5,
  "hasLeadership": true,
  "leadershipScope": "team"
}

Be accurate and use official O*NET SOC codes. The SOC code format is XX-XXXX.XX (e.g., 15-1252.00).
